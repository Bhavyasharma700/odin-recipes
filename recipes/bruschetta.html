    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bruschetta is an Italian starter dish that is made from grilled bread topped with Olive oil and salt. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sourdough bread loaf</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To start off, we will be boiling the tomates in salted water for about 5 minutes to make them soft enough 
                to be shredded and made into a paste.</li>
            <li>While the tomatoes are boiling, we have an opportunistic window to grab a bread knife and start cutting 
                the sourdough into slices that aren't too thick or too thin. We need the slices to be just wide enough that they
                get cooked well in the oven and get a crusty texture within 5 minutes of being in the oven.</li>
            <li>When you have the slices ready, apply a thin layer of olive oil and put them on a baking tray over a baking paper.</li>
            <li>While the bread slices get cooked, you can prepare the tomato spread. Drain the hot water and run the tomatoes in cold water 
                to help the seperation of the skin from the pulp. Peel off the skin and scoop out the seeds and hollow out the tomatoes. </li>
            <li>Put all the tomatoes in a shreadder with basil leaves, olive oil and salt. It is important that there is very low water 
                content to avoid the bread getting soggy when we apply the spread.</li>    
            <li>Don't forget to take out the bread before it gets burned.</li>
            <li>Serve the bread slices in a basket and the finished spread in a bowl. Enjoy!</li>
