    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bruschetta is an Italian starter dish that is made from grilled bread topped with olive oil and salt. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sourdough bread loaf</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To start off, boil the tomates in salted water for about 5 minutes to make them soft enough 
                to be shredded and made into a paste.</li>
            <li>While the tomatoes are boiling, grab a bread knife and start cutting the sourdough into slices. We need the slices to be thick enough that they
                get grilled thoroughly enough in the oven and get a crusty texture without the top surface getting burnt.</li>
            <li>When you have the slices ready, apply a thin layer of olive oil and put them in a baking tray over a baking paper.</li>
            <li>While the bread slices get grilled, you can prepare the tomato spread. Drain the hot water and run the tomatoes in cold water 
                to help the seperation of the skin from the pulp. Peel off the skin and scoop out the seeds and hollow out the tomatoes. </li>
            <li>Put all the tomatoes in a shreadder with basil leaves, olive oil and salt. It is important that the tomatoes are hollowed out properly to avoid the paste from ending up watery which will make the toasts soggy.</li>    
            <li>Serve the toasts in a basket and the spread in a bowl. Enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
